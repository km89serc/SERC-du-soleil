      <h3>Siamese Cat Appearance</h3>
      <p>The Siamese is built on long athletic lines, standing tall on slender legs with neat oval paws. 
        Ears are large, pricked and give an intelligent expression, following the lines of the triangular shaped head. 
        Eyes are almond shape and slant inwards towards the nose, and the tail is long, tapering, and straight. 
        The coat is short and fine, lying close against the body and the Siamese colours are pale, with darker shaded points, i.e., the face, ears, legs and tail. </p>

       <p>In terms of appearance, there are two Siamese cat types, the traditional one who is plumper and has an apple-shaped head 
        and the modern one who is very slender and whose head is more wedge-shaped. </p>

      <h3>Siamese Cat Personality</h3>
      <p>Incredibly intelligent, affectionate and opinionated, they are considered the extroverts of the feline world. 
        Inclined to bond strongly to one person, and often very vocal with a loud, low-pitched voice (known as a meezer), 
        the Siamese is very much a Marmite type of cat, appealing to a very specific sort of person!</p> 

       <p> Due to their rather dependent nature and attachment to their person, Siamese often suffer from separation anxiety 
        and may be better in pairs, or better still, in homes where someone is around most of the time. </p>

      <h3>History and Origins</h3>        
      <p> <strong>Origin: Thailand</strong> </p>
        <p>One of the first distinctly recognised breeds of Asian cat, the Siamese originates from Thailand, then called Siam, 
            and in the 19th Century, was one of the most popular breeds across both Europe and North America. 
            In 1884 the British Consul-General in Bangkok brought a pair of cats, Pho and Mia, back to Britain as a gift for his sister Lilian Gould, 
            who went on to co-found the Siamese Cat Club in 1901. </p> 

        <p>Recognised for their distinctive markings, the term Siamese is now used to refer to a variety of cats of the same colour pattern. The Siamese cat 
            is known as the pointed pattern and is caused by a mutation in the enzyme involved in melanin production. 
            The mutated enzyme is heat-sensitive - in that it does not work at normal body temperatures but becomes active at the lower temperatures on the extremities of the body. 
            This means the fur on those cooler areas is much darker than the fur on the warmer parts. Siamese kittens are born pure white or cream and as the fur grows and is affected by the enzyme, 
            the coloured points develop. </p>
