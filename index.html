      <h3>Meowmix</h3>
      <p>The contemporary breed of Sphynx cat is distinct from the Russian hairless cat breeds, like Peterbald and Donskoy.<br> 
        Although hairless cats have been reported throughout history, breeders in Europe have been developing the Sphynx breed since the early 1960s.</p>

      <h3>No hair balls here...</h3>
      <p> Hairlessness in cats is a naturally occurring genetic mutation,<br> 
        and the Sphynx was developed through selective breeding of these animals, starting in the 1960s.</p>
